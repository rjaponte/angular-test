# AngularMaterialPwaSsr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

The project uses [Angular Universal](https://angular.io/guide/universal) and [Service Workers](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) to show server side rendering (ssr) and PWA.

In addition it also uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for most of the UI.

## Prerequisites

### Node
Download [Node](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure that it's on your path by running `node --version` or `npm --version`.

### MongoDB
This does MongoDB to show how API calls to backend work with a database.

Download from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) - make sure it's the community.

If you are using a mac and have homebrew installed use [MongoDB Brew Install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

Confirm that installation works and is on your path by running `mongod`, be aware that if you didn't create the data folder it will fail.
